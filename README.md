# Contact Agenda

Simple contact agenda, use it to save your favorite contacts including their email, name, and phone number. Use our simple interface and be sure that they will be saved on your device. As long as you don't change.. well.. your browser or delete the website's data or change your device... But, have I talked about our nice interface now with dark mode included? (dark mode is the only mode)

With a new design methodology where the final user has to use the website with 50% of zoom. This was designed like this to appeal to younger generations and promote global peace! 



# Why?

This page is a nice side project to test my abilities with Svelte in a limited amount of time.

Build with Svelte. This page helped me to understand the surface of TypeScript, and how the setup to use it with Svelte works (Kinda easy ngl, that's why I love Svelte). I did all the UI elements by hand and with Tailwind css. 

Also I used browserLocalGet and browserLocalSet, thats kinda cool too.





## Can I borrow this app without giving you credit?

Of course, why not. I'm doing my best to make the code readable, even tho this app is absolutely tiny I think I did a good job with this one. But to be honest, I don't think someone would read this at all so.. yeah use it as you please.



## Building

Well, I suppose if you're using GitHub you probably know more than I do. Just clone the repo, and make sure that all the dependencies are installed!

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
